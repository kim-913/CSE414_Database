Good sides: It's good using online DBMS since it's a public source where we can type our code down and run as long as we done 
to get a result insdead of writing in a text generator and paste to sqlite3 to run the code. It also saves our tables at once 
when we create and put values in and which is more convenient than off line DBMS such as sqlite3 because we may sometimes forget
the name of the database we stored the tables and takes long time retreving them.

Down Sides: When I'm doing this homework, there are many key words that automatically show up when hitting enter and sometimes 
they don't make sense in the context and causes me problems. Meanwhile, if users hit "go back" on the website accidentally without saving
their codes, the code will be lost and it's barely possible to retreive the code. It's also possible that we didn't finish out code in the 
first time and would be going off line without saving the code.
