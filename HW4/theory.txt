Part 3: Functional Dependency Theory (35 points)
Consider the following two relational schemas and sets of functional dependencies:
For each of the below schemas, decompose it into BCNF. Show all of your work and explain, at each step, 
which dependency violations you are correcting. Make sure you describe each step in your decomposition 
steps. (10 points each)

a. (10 points) R(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies D → B, CE → A.
    1. From D → B, D + = {D, B}. R can be represented as: R1(D, B), R2(A, C, D, E)
    2. Here, R1 is BCNF, let's operate R2.
    3. From CE → A, {C, E} + = {A, C, E}, R2 can be decomposed as: R3(A, C, E) and R4(C, D, E) 
    4. Here, check R3, R4, there's no closure in R3, R4.
    5. Thus, the final BCNF for R with the functional dependencies above is: 
        R1(D, B), R3(A, C, E), R4(C, D, E)

b. (10 points) S(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies A → E, BC → A, DE → B.
    1. From A → E, A + = {A, E}. S can be represented as S1(A, E), S2(A, B, C, D)
    2. Here, S1 is BCNF, let's operate S2
    3. From BC → A, {B, C} + = {B, C, A}, R2 cab be represented as: S3(A, B, C), S4(B, C, D)
    4. Here, check S3, S4, there's no closure in R3, R4.
    5. Thus, the final BCNF for S with the functional dependencies above is: 
        S1(A, E), S3(A, B, C), S4(B, C, D)

A set of attributes X is called closed (with respect to a given set of functional dependencies) if 
X⁺ = X. Consider a relation with schema R(A,B,C,D) and an unknown set of functional dependencies. 
For each closed attribute set below, give a set of functional dependencies that is consistent with it.

c. (5 points) All subsets of {A,B,C,D} are closed.
    Since all subsets closed, we can get:
    A -> A
    B -> B
    C -> C
    D -> D

d. (5 points) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {} and {A,B,C,D}.
    Since the only closed subsets are {} and {A,B,C,D}, we get:
    A -> B, C, D
    B -> A, C, D
    C -> A, B, D
    D -> A, B, C

e. (5 points) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}.
    Since the only closed subsets are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}, we get:
    B -> C
    C -> B
    A -> B, C, D
    D -> A, B, C
